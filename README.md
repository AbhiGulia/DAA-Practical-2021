[Error] 'nullptr' was not declared in this scope.

if in red_black_tree program, this error occurs,then change language standard (-std) to ISO C++11 in the compiler settings.

A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected, undirected graph is a 
spanning tree with a weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. The weight of a spanning 
tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.

A minimum spanning tree has (V – 1) edges where V is the number of vertices in the given graph. 

the given minimum spanning tree algorithm is Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm.
it is a greedy algorithm.
Kruskal’s algorithm’s time complexity is O(E log V), V being the number of vertices.
Kruskal’s algorithm runs faster in sparse graphs.
